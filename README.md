This project features two different versions of Slime basketball, both implemented using a JavaScript framework. One uses EaselJS and the other uses Phaser.

## Slime Basketball (Phaser)

The Phaser implementation is more recently updated.

### To Do

1. Add graphics (court, goaltending, backboards)
2. Handle ball-backboard collisions
3. Add screen text (scores, team names, time)
